# PEDRO A. GONZÁLEZ PORTFOLIO

### ABOUT

I’m a mechatronics engineer and passionate educator of software development and innovation projects around the world.

I have also cofounded a nonprofit organization to help rural communities with Internet access and educational technology, as well as a youth empowerment initiative to promote citizenship and social impact.

During my spare time I love to play chess, to skydive and to tell as many bad jokes as I can.
